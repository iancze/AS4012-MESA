Use these reader routines to analyze the output from your MESA-Web run. The output is returned as an {class}`astropy.table.Table` object. See the [Astropy Table Documentation](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/) for more on how to work with these objects. The available table keys are listed below each function. You may consult the [MESA-Web documentation](http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-output) for additional detail.
