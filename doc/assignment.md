# Assignment

## Submission
Upload the following to the Moodle:

**Report** containing the narrative text, plots, and numerical results requested for each question. You are free to prepare this report with whatever combination of tools you wish, but it must be self-contained *as a single PDF*. I would suggest either
* save plots as `*.png`, insert into Word or LaTeX document, add text, save to PDF.
* work directly in a Jupyter Notebook, adding text with markdown cells, export to PDF.

**Code**: your `*.py` or `*.ipynb` files. Alternatively create a "secret" [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) with your code and submit the link.

## Questions

1. (2pts) Read [Asplund et al. 2009ARA&A..47..481A](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ARA%26A..47..481A/abstract), paying particular attention to Section 1, Section 3, and Tables 1 and 3. What are the recommended values of $X$, $Y$, $Z$, and $XC$ for the protosun, how do they differ from the present day values, and why?

2. (2pts) Choose one initial stellar mass from the set of {0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2} $M_\odot$ and run [MESA-Web](http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web) with the following additional parameters: $Z = 0.02$, ?
    
    2.1. Create plots of output of your run using the script (also Jup?), as shown in the plotting example. Submit figures for XX, XX, and YY?
    
    2.2. What are the initial $X$, $Y$, $Z$, and $XC$ abundances in this model, and how do they compare to those recommended by Asplund+09? 

3. (2ps) From your plots, identify  Reference the Zero-Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) stage, after the model has settled but before the core helium abundance starts to increase significantly. From your plots
